Project Overview
This project explores unicorn companies (startups valued at over $1 billion) using SQL for data analysis. The goal is to examine various aspects of unicorn companies such as their valuations, industries, and geographic distribution. By leveraging SQL queries, we can uncover insights into where unicorns are founded, their growth over time, and which industries dominate.

Dataset
The dataset is a CSV file containing details of unicorn companies with the following fields:

Company: Name of the unicorn company
Valuation: Current valuation of the company
Date Joined: Date the company became a unicorn
Industry: The industry the company operates in
City: The city the company is based in
Country: The country where the company is headquartered
Continent: The continent the company belongs to
Year Founded: The year the company was founded
Funding: Total funding raised by the company
Select Investors: Notable investors of the company
Key Features
Database Schema: A structured SQL schema for importing and organizing unicorn company data.
SQL Queries: Example queries to filter, sort, and aggregate data for analysis, such as:
Companies founded in a specific year.
Valuations of the top unicorns.
The total number of unicorns per country and continent.
Data Aggregation: Analyze trends by grouping and performing aggregate functions like counting unicorns by country or finding the highest valuations.
Advanced SQL: Implement complex queries such as subqueries and joins (optional).

How to Use
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Create a SQL database and import the dataset (Unicorn_Companies.csv).
Run the SQL scripts included in the scripts/ folder to set up the database and execute sample queries.
Explore the data using SQL queries to extract insights on the unicorn companies.
Key SQL Operations
Filtering: Filter companies by country, year founded, or industry.
Sorting: Sort companies based on valuation or funding raised.
Aggregating: Group data by country or continent to analyze trends.
Subqueries: Perform more complex analysis using subqueries and advanced SQL features.
Conclusion
This project serves as a comprehensive SQL learning exercise and provides valuable insights into unicorn companies worldwide. The dataset, along with SQL scripts, is designed to help users perform a range of queries and analyze trends in the startup ecosystem.
